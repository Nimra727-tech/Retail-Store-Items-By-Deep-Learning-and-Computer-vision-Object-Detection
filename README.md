# Retail-Store-Items-Detection
Retail Store Items Detection is a deep learning–based computer vision project that focuses on automatically detecting and classifying retail products from images. The system uses a CNN-based object detection approach to identify multiple items in a single image and highlight them with bounding boxes and labels. This project aims to reduce manual effort in billing and inventory management. It demonstrates the practical application of AI in smart retail automation.
