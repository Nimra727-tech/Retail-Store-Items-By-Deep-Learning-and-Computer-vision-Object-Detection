# Retail-Store-Items-By-Deep-Learning-and-Computer-vision-Object-Detection
Retail Store Items Detection is a deep learning–based computer vision project that focuses on automatically detecting and classifying retail products from images. The system uses a CNN-based object detection approach to identify multiple items in a single image and highlight them with bounding boxes and labels.
